    <strong>COVID-19 UPDATE:</strong> Guitar repairs are still being done, but
    drop-offs will be at the front door and only one person can enter when
    picking up. Everyone in our home is healthy. If you, or someone in your home
    is sick, please save your guitar repair until you are all well. Give me a
    call if you have any questions. Stay safe everyone!

      Jim is a unique combination of guitar master, repair guru and great guy.
      His passion for the guitar shows through everything he does; I am loving
      the custom Tele he sold me last year. You can't go wrong with sending your
      babies to Jim. He'll take great care of them as he did with my Strat.
      Thanks brother..!

    in, just give me a call and I can keep an eye out for you. Because I am a

    bass, give me a call at
