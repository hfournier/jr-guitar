        I fell in love with the guitar when I was 10. And I've been a working
        musician (drummer, bassist, guitarist, and lead vocalist) since I was 15
        years old. My musical mainstays are Top 40, Classic Rock, and Country.
        I've also worked as a studio musician in Vancouver and throughout BC.

        You may have heard me play in Kelowna, the greater Okanagan, or
        elsewhere in BC. I play in a

      <p>
        Through years of playing small clubs in Northern BC, I became a guitar
        tech out of necessity. I learned to repair my guitar, which lead to
        doing repairs and setups for my fellow band members. When musicians
        played my guitars, they noticed that their "play-ability" was
        significantly better. Quite often, they would bring me their guitars for
        a proper setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        For several years, I worked for various music stores as their setup and
        repair tech. In 2004, I opened a guitar repair shop in Kelowna, BC
        called JR Guitar. My services now include building Fender-style electric
        guitars. These strats and teles are usually my first choice to play.

    is an acoustic and dance music duo I have formed with my wife, Kim
    Foreman-Rhindress.

    We sing a wide variety of acoustic and rock songs. Our repertoire is perfect
    for any weddings, wineries, corporate functions, or private parties. I play
    electric guitar, Kim plays keys, and we use backing tracks for the bass and
    drums. We guarantee you a great night of dance music, classic rock, and 80s
    & 90s pop songs.

    For special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or weddings, we can
    write customs songs. And, we can even deliver a singing telegram.
