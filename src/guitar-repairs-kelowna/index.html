  <h2>Fret Jobs</h2>
  <h2>Set-ups</h2>
  <p>
    Any guitar you buy will play and sound better with a professional set-up.
    Many guitars people thought were "unplayable" are often salvageable.
  </p>
  <h2>Restoration</h2>
  <p>
    Jim has resurrected instruments as varied as a 100 year old mandolin, a 1951
    Gibson and a 1920's banjo. He salvaged an acoustic guitar after a car had
    driven over it. He was able to resell it to one of Kelowna's most
    experienced musicians, who was blown away by its amazing tone!
  </p>
  <p>
    We are not promising miracles, but it is surprising what skill, experience,
    the right tools, and a <strong>ton of patience</strong> can accomplish!
  </p>
  <h2>Modifications</h2>
  <p>
    Jim also custom builds electric guitars and can modify yours to be the
    instrument you've always dreamed it could be.

      ever.
