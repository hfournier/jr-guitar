      I have a 70 yr old Gibson j45 and have issues from time to time as it
      gets well used. I recently had a fan brace that came undone under the top
      of the body. Very tricky fix. Jim repaired it perfect for me and I was
      back playing her in just a few days. Jim has replaced frets and, well
      anything that's needed, he does. He is a specialist when it comes to tune-
      ups. If your guitar is playing or sounding off, he's defiantly the guy who
      will bring it back to life. And his prices are from yesterday. If I could
      give 6 stars on his business I would!

      Jim did an excellent job installing a few parts on my stratocaster. He
      gives great advice, and he's a very friendly. I wouldn't go anywhere else
      to have my guitars looked at.

      Passing on my dad's 1923 Leedy Tenor banjo to my daughter and wanted to
      get it checked out first. The banjo is 96 years old, hasn't been played
      since the 60's and has always been strung. Found JR Guitar Repair online,
      and with nothing but straight 5/5 ratings, knew Jim was the guy. Spot on
      estimate, excellent work and very reasonable price. My daughter and I are
      thrilled! Thanks again Jim!

      I took my Mom's 75 year old Ukulele to Jim to have it restored and he
      did an amazing job ! It needed tuners, strings, fret work and repair of
      some cracks and it came back to life like new !! My Mom loved it ..over
      the moon ..and it was a wonderful surprise for her. She's 87 years old and
      bought the Uke when she was 12. It was very affordable and Jim was such a
      pleasure to deal with. Thank you Jim!

      feels and plays 100 times better than when I brought it to him. Great
      work, clear communication, wonderful outcome, and surprisingly affordable.
      I will be bringing my other ukes to Jim. I know he'll make a difference.

      Happen to find Jim while googling guitar setup in Kelowna. Read some
      reviews and decided to have him work on my lefty Strat. It's a tough
      guitar to get nice low action and he was able to get mine to where I've
      been wanting it for quite a while. Great job and very personable, I highly
      recommend his skill for your guitar setup!!

      After moving to BC, found my 50 year old guitar had been 'compromised'
      during transit. Jim undertook a structural repair, which was well crafted
      and invisible. Jim went on to polish the frets and fretboard and hand
      carve a new bone bridge with a full set up. Work was done promptly,
      professionally and the guitar has never sounded this good. The set up
      greatly enhanced resonance and tone on all notes and chords. It's better
      than new. Impressive workmanship and knowledgable, and generous with time
      and effort. Excellent value for minimal cost. Thank you Jim.

  - comment: Jim helped me bring my vintage bass back to life. New strings, new
      frets, set-up with great intonation all the things that it takes to make
      instruments do what they are supposed to do. He did it fast and his rates
      were great. Call this man and let him do work for you!

      I have a Gibson SG 61 re-issue. I always wanted this guitar but when I
      got it, i was very disappointed. I actually considered getting rid of it
      but thought I would take it to Jim first. Jim did a lot of fret work, made
      serious adjustments to neck, as well as all the standard action and
      intonation stuff. Guitar is amazing now! It plays the way I thought it
      should and I love it. Wow... a proper setup makes all the difference in
      the world! I would highly recommend him. Thanks Jim!

      Jim did great work fine tuning the set up on my Les Paul. Over a year
      ago the guitar had suffered a fall that resulted in one of the machine
      heads getting torn off. While I had repaired this myself with only a
      moderate degree of success, the instrument was super difficult to keep in
      tune and also had some intonation problems. Jim remedied all of that. The
      frets are like new, the intonation is spot on and the tuning is totally
      solid. He made the guitar a pleasure to play again. I recommend his work
      without reservation.

  - comment: While visiting Kelowna, the neck on my Taylor developed a serious
      crack. Recently I broke my hand in a motorcycle accident. Besides the
      obvious reasons to want my guitar fixed ,it also is an important part of
      my physiotherapy. I found Jim's name online and took my guitar to him.
      When he found out my situation he immediately went to work on the guitar
      and repaired it beautifully. Despite being a busy time of year and me
      being a transient customer he went out of his way. I thanked him of course
      and tried to tell him how grateful I am. A talented man with a huge heart.

  - comment: Jim is great at setting up guitars! He's helped so many including
      myself, in giving Cool options on electric guitars. Jim is a good
      guitarist which helps him Relate to singer/guitarists like myself as he
      understands the issues that occur with electrics. If you haven't got
      anyone to help you with your guitar... Call Jim and you'll be taken care
      of.

  - comment: I have a variety of guitars and had them all set up by Jim. Most
      recently he worked on my 59 Les Paul Jr. He brought it to life and treated
      it like it was his own. I Jim appreciate his professionalism and pride he
      takes in his work. If you need guitar work this is the place! Thanks Jim.

      If you need repairs or fret work done Jim is the guy you need to see.
      He is passionate about guitars and provides very exacting workmanship. He
      strikes me as someone who isn’t happy until you are. I am extremely
      pleased with the work he did on my 40 year old Ovation Legend guitar as
      well as my Fender Stratocaster. I highly recommend him.

      I just wanted to say I get all my guitars set up by Jim. I am a builder
      however even the best made guitars won't play well or even at all unless
      you have set them up properly. That's where Jim comes into the picture. I
      love to build guitars but set up I leave to him completely. He recieves
      fro me a fresh built guitar with the bridge attached and then the magic
      begins. When I get a guitar back it plays unbelievable. It sounds amazing
      and is taken care of so well. I can't say enough about Jim's workmen ship.
      He brings life to my guitars. Will be using Jim exclusively for all my
      builds.

  - comment: Jim is a unique combination of guitar master, repair guru and great
      guy. His passion for the guitar shows through everything he does; I am
      loving the custom Tele he sold me last year. You can't go wrong with
      sending your babies to Jim. He'll take great care of them as he did with
      my Strat. Thanks brother!

      I've had Jim work on a few of my guitars over the years. Jim's work is
      exceptional, my accoustic was a pawn shop special that I dragged around
      the planet with me for 15 years it got to the point where it was almost
      unplayable. Jim internated straightened out the neck filed some frets and
      now it plays unreal. Everyone always comments on how well it plays. Jim
      also built a telecaster for me which I think is an anomaly because no
      matter how rough I am with that thing it always stays in tune. I will be
      going back to Jim to get a Bigsby attached. I have no hesitations
      recommending Jim's work to anyone interested in buying a guitar or getting
      one worked on.
